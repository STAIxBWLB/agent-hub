# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- npm distribution: `@staix/agent-hub`, public publishing with provenance from the tag workflow, tarball content checks, and an actionable Bun requirement when the CLI is invoked with Node or an unsupported Bun version.

- `ahub ask`: answers from the task board, shared memory and the hub log, evidence first; the answer has to cite the ids it rests on.

## 0.1.0

First public release.

- Messaging core: N-peer bus with untrusted framing, hop cap, dedupe, one queue per peer; adapters for Claude Code (channel plugin), Codex (app-server proxy) and Kimi Code (ACP).
- Coordination: `[IMPORTANT]` / `[STATUS]` / `[FYI]` tiers, digests, `turn/steer` for a busy Codex, queue bounds, pause and resume, session-start recall from claude-mem.
- `local`: a hub-native worker on a self-hosted model through an OpenAI-compatible gateway, with scoped tools, approvals and a macOS sandbox; optional Switchyard sidecar with fallback; claude-mem capture.
- Task board with role contracts, routing policy (`routing.toml`), an enforced on-prem path for PII, review handoff and escalation, task briefs and shared notes.
- Budget relay: quota sources, checkpoint then pause, handoff to `local` first, resume on reset.
- Packaging: `ahub` CLI (alias `agent-hub`) installable from GitHub, `ahub setup`, one version across CLI, plugin and MCP server, CI on Ubuntu and macOS, tagged releases.
- Internal inference (optional, fail-open): condensed status digests and task class triage.
